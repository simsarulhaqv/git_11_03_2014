In software development , 

GIT is a D V C S (Distributed Version Control System) with an emphasis on speed .

Initially made by Linus Torvalds because he did not like the propriatory nature of 
Bit keeper (the only available git VCS at that time)

He combined the original ideas of Bitkeep and mercurial together with some more of his ideas
and created GIT in about 3 days.
